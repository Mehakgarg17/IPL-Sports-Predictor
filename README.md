# IPL Sports Predictor

## Overview
The IPL Sports Predictor is a machine learning project built with Python to predict the outcome of Indian Premier League (IPL) matches.

## The project uses:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): To explore team & player performance trends.
2. Logistic Regression: To build a predictive model for match results.
3. Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, and F1 Score to measure performance.
This project demonstrates how data analysis + machine learning can be applied to sports analytics to forecast real-world outcomes.

## Features
1. Perform EDA with Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
2. Clean and preprocess IPL datasets (Players.xlsx & deliveries.csv).
3. Encode categorical data (team names, venues, toss winners, etc.) using OneHotEncoder.
4. Train a Logistic Regression model to classify winning teams.
5. Evaluate predictions with accuracy, precision, and F1 score.

## Tech Stack
1. Programming Language: Python
2. Libraries Used:
   2.1. numpy – Numerical operations
   2.2. pandas – Data manipulation
   2.3. matplotlib, seaborn – Data visualization
   2.4. scikit-learn – ML model building & evaluation
